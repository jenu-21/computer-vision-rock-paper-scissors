# Computer Vision RPS

##  Create the computer vision system 
Using teachable-machine we created an image model using the webcam for rock, paper, scissors and nothing.

This is then trained by the programme and eventually exported from the Tensorflow tab onto local files which is then later pushed onto the github account.
 
## Creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game
Create another file called manual_rps.py that will be used to play the game without the camera through functions: get_computer_choice and get_user_choice and eventually further coding to work out who won.
