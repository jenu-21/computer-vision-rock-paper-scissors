# Computer Vision RPS

##  Create the computer vision system 
Using teachable-machine we created an image model using the webcam for rock, paper, scissors and nothing.

This is then trained by the programme and eventually exported from the Tensorflow tab onto local files which is then later pushed onto the github account.
